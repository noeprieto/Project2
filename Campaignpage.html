	The problem is Global warming and the problem is that the world id getting hotter day by day. The hotter the earth gets the more the ice melts and when the ice melts the water level rises. That causes chaos and danger, its also causes the oceans to get warmer which messes up the animals migrations paterns. Overall it messes up the world in many ways. We need to plant more trees to get more oxygen in the air. We also need to cut down on the use of fossil fuels to cut down on the greenhouse gasses. I can take action by planting trees in my local community and using a bike to go to school.
